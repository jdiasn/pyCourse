The language name does not came from *sweet* reptile. That comes from comedy 
series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". If you want to see some of Monty 
Python's movies, here is `Monty Python's Life of Brian <https://youtu.be/

Requirements
------------
To take a better advantage of this course, the student should install 
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ (python distribution).
This distribution has a large number of libraries pre installed.

Jupyter Notebook

The main development environment used during this course is the `Jupyter Notebook 
<http://jupyter.org/index.html>`_. If you already installed Anaconda, you have to
open a terminal and to run the Jupyter Notebook.

.. code-block:: console

After to run it, the following message will appear


.. code-block:: console

   [I 22:45:52.397 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/userName/projects
   [I 22:45:52.397 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels 
   [I 22:45:52.397 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
   [I 22:45:52.398 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
