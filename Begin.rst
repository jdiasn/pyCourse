In Python the variables are dynamically typed, meaning that Python identifies the kind of 
variable by itself. Here is a list of the most basic types: 

- Integer
- Float 
- String
- NoneType
- List
- Tuples 
- Dictionaries

Python supports arithmetic operations, and they are calculated using:

- \+ for addition
- \- for subtraction 
- / for division
- \* for multiplication
- ** for exponentiation

The comparison operations are possible too; here is the operators: 

- > for greater than
- < for less than
- >= for grater than or equal to 
- <= for less than or equal to 
- != for not equal 
- == for equal

Integer 

.. code-block:: python

   >>> a = 11
   >>> type(a)
   <type 'int'>


Float

.. code-block:: python

   >>> a = 11.
   >>> type(a)
   <type 'float'>
